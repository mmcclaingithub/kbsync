# create a merge request from the command line

the first time you push a branch, git will give you a url you can use to create a merge request

# create a merge request in GitLab

- in the 'Merge requests' tab, click the 'New merge request' button
  - select your issue branch as the 'Source branch' and 'main' as the 'Target branch'
  - select the 'mr-template' for the description
  - set the 'Assignee' (usually the DPM)
  - set the 'Reviewer' if the MR is ready for review, otherwise do that when it is ready
  - if you don't plan to publish the changes upon merging them, add the 'hold' label
- click 'Create merge request'

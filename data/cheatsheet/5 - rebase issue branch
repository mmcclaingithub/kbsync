#⚡ rebase issue branch onto main

$[main] git pull // synchronize your 'main' with any remote changes - no changes = no need to rebase

$[main] git switch issue-id // switch/checkout the issue branch you want to rebase

$[issue-branch] git status // make sure you have no uncommited changes

$[issue-branch] git rebase origin/main // add changes from origin main to your issue branch

☝️  review the changes - does the log make sense, does the rendered AsciiDoc look just right?

$[issue-branch] git push -f // force push required any time you have rebased a branch

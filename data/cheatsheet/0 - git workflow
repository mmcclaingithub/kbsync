âš¡ git workflow

// this is an overview
// see individual cheatsheets for commands

## create an issue branch
   - branch name = Jira issue key
   
## make an empty initial commit on your issue branch
   - this prevents amending someone else's commit
   
## make changes on your issue branch and commit them
   - using 'git commit --amend`

## preview your changes in your editor (VSCode, Atom, etc)
   - don't build when you can avoid it
   
## push your issue branch to origin as you commit work
   - for both backup and for sharing

## preview your changes again on GitLab
   - they should look the same as local preview in your editor
   
## rebase your issue branch regularly
   - this keeps it synched with origin main

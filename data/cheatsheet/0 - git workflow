# git workflow

// this is an overview
// see individual cheatsheets for commands

1. Create an issue branch
   
2. Make an empty initial commit on your issue branch
   - this prevents amending someone else's commit
   
3. Make changes on your issue branch and commit them
   - using 'git commit --amend'

5. Preview your changes in your editor (VSCode, Atom, etc)
   - don't build when you can avoid it
   
6. Push your issue branch to origin as you commit work
   - for both backup and for sharing

7. Preview your changes again on GitLab
   - they should look the same as local preview in your editor
   
8. Rebase your issue branch regularly
   - this keeps it synched with origin main

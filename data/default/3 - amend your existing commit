// the goal here is a single commit on your issue branch instead of multiple commits

$[issue-branch] git status // confirm the files that have uncommited changes

$[issue-branch] git add -A // stage all the files with changes

$[issue-branch] git log --oneline // confirm the most recent commit on this branch is yours

⚠️  if the most recent commit is not yours and one created on this issue branch, do not proceed - you may still need to make an initial commit

$[issue-branch] git commit --amend // amend the previous commit

⚠️  to back-out without amending the commit, save a completely empty commit message

☝️  espanso trigger: `:amend`
